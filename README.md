## YT-playlist-merger
This small script uses the youtube API to merge youtube playlist with no repetition of videos.

### 1. Get your access to the youtube API
There are many tutorials out there of how to get access to the "YOUR SECRET CLIENT FILE"

### 2. Fix the script with the correct location of your secret client file
You can do this by changing line 18.

### 3. Install python

### 4. Run the script in the cmd
After you run the script, it will ask you for your playlist ID, which you can get from the url. After collecting all the info of said playlist, it will request the id of the playlist you want to add. It will add all the videos to the first playlist after requesting permission in the browser.

### Extra info
Since the base youtube API has limited petitions, you may need to run the script a couple times for larger playlists.
